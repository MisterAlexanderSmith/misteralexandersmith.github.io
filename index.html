                <p>Can you guess what that timer is?<br/><br/>It's how old I am!  Down to the second. Cool, right? But as you might realise, to figure that out I' d need to know exactly when I was born !<br/>I do.<br/><abbr title="In Scotland">I was born at exactly midnight.</abbr><br/>Pretty cool,
                    right? But here's the cool part... My parents got to choose which day my birthday was, the 20th or the 21st.

                <p>As some of you may have noticed,
                    my toothypegs look odd.<br/>This is because my teeth have suffered from <abbr title="A developmental dental condition where the enamel is softer and less mineralised than normal, making teeth more prone to breakdown and decay.">hypermineralisation.</abbr><br/>Sadly,
                    my adult teeth or "permanent teeth" have hypermineralisation.<br/>So they won't just fall out, and the other ones will be better.

        <div class="rect r3 jsr"><p>I was born at exactly midnight and my parents got to choose my birthday. That means I can figure out that I'm <span id="age"></span> old.</p></div>
        <div class="rect r4 jsr"><p>I have hypomineralisation and that's why my teeth look weird and I need to take extra care of them.</p></div>
        <div class="rect r5 jsr"><p>I like:<br/><br/>    1) Food and lots of it! My fav food is my Dad's  pizza, we have it every Friday.<br/><br/>  2) Coding, duh. I coded this whole thing, of course I like it.<br/><br/>  3) Maths. Don't ask why. I liked maths before I liked coding.<br/><br/>  4) Sleep. It's pretty fun, I guess?<br/><br/>   5) Reading, it's not the best thing in the world but it's still a solid pass time.<br/><br/>   6) Salt... IDK<br/> <br/>   7) Wind! I love it when it's a nice cold-ish windy day! Perfect conditions are: wind, a blanket odf cloud nice and grey so the sun doesn't cook you and even more wind  a piece of paper shoud be able to stay up if you face the wind and place it on your belly.</p></div>
        <div class="rect r6 jsr"><p>I don't like:<br/><br/>    1) Taylor Swift, I am proudly part of the Slowy Alliance<br/><br/>  2) Mushrooms, I just don't like their consistency.<br/><br/>  3) Sushi becuse they have...<br/><br/>  4) Seaweed on the outside. I used to like sushi and seaweed when I was little, but then someone told me it came from the sea and that put me off. Didn't realise fish came from the sea too.<br/><br/>   5) I just hate it when you're on the beach, eating fish&chips and then, all of a sudden, you're rolling on the sand, clutching your stomach when there's still chips left!!!<br/><br/>   6) Rain. No explanation required. Although, when your out and about it can be refreshing if a bit of light rain starts up.</p></div>
        <div class="rect r7 jsr"><p>In my family I've got: Me, my bro, my dad and my Mum.</p></div>
